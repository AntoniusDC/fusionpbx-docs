## Signing The CLA

Hello, Potential Contributor.

We at FusionPBX are excited to collaborate with you, whether you're contributing code, documentation, or translations, in order for us to accept any patches,
you must electronically sign a statement that indicates two things:

-   You are willingly licensing your contributions under the terms of
    the open source license of the project that you're contributing to.
-   You are legally able to license your contributions as stated.

The reason we do this is to ensure, to the extent possible, that we
don't "taint" the projects we manage with contributions that turn out to
be improper. This protects everyone who wants to use the projects,
including *you*! If you want a longer explanation, then you can check
out the [CLA Rationale](https://github.com/Fusionpbx/opensource/blob/master/cla-rationale.md) Page.

Once you sign the Contributor License Agreement (the "CLA"), we will
then be able to merge your contributions with a clear conscience and
with only the friction that results from the usual technical
back-and-forth of a vibrant open source project.

To get started with this process.
